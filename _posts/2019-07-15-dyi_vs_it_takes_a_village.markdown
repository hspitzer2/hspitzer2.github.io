I am one month into the Parttime program at Flatiron School. In the beginning, I would spend a lot of time working my way through the labs...trying desperately to force the information and understanding into my stubborn brain. As a teacher,  I compared it to learning to read all over again...first the letters, then the blends, then the words, and eventually sentences and paragraphs. Tangentially, this process has given me a renewed compassion for my students' learning process. It's easy to give in and say, "I'm not smart enough, who was I kidding, I can't do this!" but that's simply not true. If you are reading this right now, you know that eventually, you managed to learn to read too. 


My biggest take away so far is relinquishing the belief that I am in it alone. Ask a Question, is there for a reason, use it...and stop spinning in place. Find a study partner, use pairing sessions, watch tutorial videos, attend the weekly meetings, take good notes on what you are learning, find a good book source...but put your ego and sense of vulnerability aside. Going to weekly group hot-potatoes is sometimes intimidating...and it's hard not to compare your progress with that of others in the class. But again, it forces you to recognize where your gaps are, and celebrate your new strengths. Disgusting your work is illuminating and you'll find that there is more than one way to solve a problem; you learn that there are many, many, people, like you, and some who you've already decided are smarter than you, who are also questioning their abilities to process this. The answer is to just keep coding...it will sink in. You will have as many moments of clarity as you do with confusion. Embracing that *place of not knowing*, and the ability to seek answers, is, in fact, learning to code, and a large part of coding itself.
Here is a video recording of Avi in London. For some reason, when I am feeling down, I watch it and it gives me a renewed sense of purpose. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9I2uvkwKhc&t=9s
